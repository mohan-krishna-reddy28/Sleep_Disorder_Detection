# 😴 Sleep Disorder Detection & Classification using Deep Learning

A real-time sleep disorder detection and classification system built using **Deep Learning (CNN + LSTM)** and deployed through a **Django web application**.  
The model analyzes sleep data and predicts disorders such as **Sleep Apnea, Insomnia, Narcolepsy**, and other abnormal sleep patterns.

This project was developed as part of the **B.Tech Final Year Project** at  
📍 *Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering, Tirupati*
